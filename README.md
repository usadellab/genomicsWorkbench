## Camelina Knowledge Hub
The Camelina Knowledge Hub is a web platform developed as part of the UNTWIST project.
UNTWIST studies stress adaptation mechanisms in camelina, a naturally resilient European oilseed crop. By understanding how camelina copes with stress, researchers aim to develop strategies to improve yield stability in camelina and other crops under challenging environmental conditions.

### The Camelina Knowledge Hub offers:
- A curated collection of camelina-related data and information.
- Tools for analyzing and visualizing camelina data.
- Resources for researchers interested in camelina stress adaptation.
